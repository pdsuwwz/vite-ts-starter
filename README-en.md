## 🪄 Using Different UI Libraries

If you prefer using [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/) as your UI library, we've also prepared several corresponding template projects for you. You can use these as a foundation for secondary business development and customization:

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) Setup

This project supports multi-language settings, with `English` as the default language.

### Default Language Configuration


The default language is set through the [`defaultLanguageLocale`](src/locales/index.ts#L43) constant. To change the default language, simply modify the value of this constant:

```ts
export const defaultLanguageLocale = 'en'
```

### Extending Supported Languages

The project currently supports the following languages, as detailed in [src/locales/index.ts](src/locales/index.ts#L13):

```ts
export const localesMapping = [
  {
    localeCode: 'zh-hans',
    localeName: '简体中文',
    localeLang: {...}
  },
  {
    localeCode: 'en',
    localeName: 'English',
    localeLang: {...}
  }
]
```

To add support for a new language:

  * Add a new language object to the [`localesMapping`](src/locales/index.ts#L13) array
  * Create a corresponding language file in the [`src/locales/lang/`](src/locales/lang/) directory (e.g., de.ts for German)

    ```
    ./lang
    ├── en.ts
    └── zh-hans.ts
    ```
  * Import and merge the `Element Plus` language pack and custom language file, ensuring both UI components and custom content are localized.


## 💡 Tip

* If Husky is not working, it may be due to incomplete initialization. Try running the following command to initialize:

```bash
pnpm run prepare
```
